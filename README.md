# WordPronouncer

This is a small sample android app that takes the text from user and pronouncer the text by using google's TextToSpeech API.

I tried adding fetching meaning of the text but got stuck at parseing the json so put all the code realated to that in comments(feel free look around and contribute if know parsing xml)

it also has a floating window so that user doesn't need to come out of their currrent reading app to know the pronounciation.

thats about it, contributions are welcome.
